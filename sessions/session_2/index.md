### Basic GWAS analyses
- Basic GWAS testing.
- Meta-analyses.
- Visualizations.
- Annotating GWAS results.

### Practical
- To perform a basic GWAS using linear and logistic regression.
- To display simple visualization of GWAS results and post GWAS QC.
- To provide additional considerations and for deploying GWAS in real studies.
- To provide a simple meta-analysis example and results

### Data Used
GWAS: Reilly MP, Li M, He J, Ferguson JF, Stylianou IM, Mehta NN, et al.
