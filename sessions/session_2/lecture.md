Practical session description 

## Basic GWAS analyses

### Overview
In this exercise, we will be using plink to perform Genome Wide Association Studies using the publicly available PennCath data. First, we will evaluate the data with a continous outcome using linear regression and covariates estimated from the --pca step in last lecture. Then, we will evaluate our results using Quantile-Quantile Plots (QQplots), Manhattan plots, and Regional plots for follow-up. We will also perform another GWAS using the binary trait Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and logistic regression which is often what we use when evaluating germline genetic susceptibility to cancer.
