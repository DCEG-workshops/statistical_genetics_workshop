## Supplemental

Several different fine mapping software are used commonly for post-GWAS analysis. There is no universal "best" method. Most suitable method usually depends on different factors including causal scenarios, underlying statistical model/method, computational feasibility and others. Here is a (partially complete) list of software that have been used in post GWAS _in silico_ analyses.

## Additional Fine-mapping software:

- PAINTOR: [Link](https://github.com/gkichaev/PAINTOR_V3.0)
- CAVIAR/eCAVIAR: [Link](https://github.com/fhormoz/caviar)
- FINEMAP: [Link](http://www.christianbenner.com/)
- CARMA: [Link](https://github.com/Iuliana-Ionita-Laza/CARMA)
- PolyFun: [Link](https://github.com/omerwe/polyfun)

You can visit the vignette pages for each of these to learn and understand more about the intuition of the methods and find the suitable application for your analysis.

## Additional colocalization software:

- HyPrColoc: [Link](https://github.com/jrs95/hyprcoloc) : Colocalization with more than 2 traits/outcomes to choose the best subset of colocalizing outcomes.
