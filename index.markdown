## DCEG Statistical Genetics Workshop

### Session 1: Introduction 
- Why genetic epidemiology? 
- Why GWAS and RVAS? 
- What we have learned. 
- What remains to be done. 
- Overview of the course


### Session 2: Basic GWAS analyses 
- Basic GWAS testing. 
- Meta-analyses. 
- Visualizations. 
- Annotating GWAS results.


### Session 3: Fine-mapping and colocalization 
- Statistical fine mapping. 
- Analyses for different data inputs: individual-level, summary stats with in-sample LD, summary stats with external LD reference. 
- Co-localization.  

### Session 4: Heritability, functional enrichment, polygenic scores 
- Heritability: what it is and isn't. 
- The polygenic model. 
- Methods to estimate heritability from GWAS data. 
- Polygenic risk scores defined. 
- Methods to train PRS. 
- PRS validation.

### Session 5: Rare variants 
- Most variants are rare (but most variability is common). 
- Review effect size distribution as a function of MAF. 
- Implications for study design and analysis. 
- Review Next Generation Sequencing technologies. 
- Aggregate tests.

### Session 6: Integrative analyses and Mendelian Randomization 
- [fill-in-the-blank]WAS: using genetic instruments for hypothesized intermediates to identify genetic associations. 
- TWAS Methods. 
  - TWAS limitations. 
- Other 'omics. 
- MR: using genetic instruments for hypothesized intermediates to establish causality. 
  - MR Methods. 
  - MR limitations.  

### Session 7: GWAS, fine-mapping and PRS in diverse-genetic-ancestry and admixed samples 
- Variation in human genetic variation across space and time. 
- Measures of genetic similarity and genetic ancestry. 
- GWAS in complex samples. 
- Fine mapping in complex samples. 
- Cross- and multi-ancestry PRS development.

### Session 8: Genetic mosaicism and clonal hematopoiesis 
- TBD

### Session 9: Functional genomics 
- TBD
